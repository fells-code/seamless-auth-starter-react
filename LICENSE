TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

The “Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
make or receive copies.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent
that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that displays an
appropriate copyright notice, and tells the user that there is no warranty for
the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
