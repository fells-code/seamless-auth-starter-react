# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Seamless Auth takes security seriously.
We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work quickly with researchers and users to investigate and resolve issues.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

---

## How to Report

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing:

security@seamlessauth.com

Include as much detail as possible:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available)
- Affected package(s) and version(s)
- Potential impact (authentication bypass, privilege escalation, data exposure, etc.)

Encrypted reports are welcome. If you need a public PGP key, request one in your initial email.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- Repositories published under the Fells Code organization
- All artifacts produced directly or indirectly under the Fells Code organization
- Official Docker images published under the Fells Code organization

Third-party dependencies are not covered, but reports identifying vulnerable dependency usage are appreciated.

---

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 72 hours
- **Initial assessment** within 5 business days
- **Fix or mitigation** as quickly as possible depending on severity

We will coordinate disclosure timing with you if a fix requires public communication.

---

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to:

- The latest published version
- The current development branch

Older versions may not receive patches unless the issue is critical.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Allow reasonable time to investigate and remediate
- Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Avoid public disclosure until a fix is released or coordinated

We believe responsible disclosure helps keep the ecosystem safer for everyone.
